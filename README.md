## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Set up a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Mac/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Required Libraries
Run the following command to install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install scrapy scrapy-selenium scrapy-proxy-pool fake-useragent
```

Alternatively, use the `requirements.txt` file if provided:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Libraries Used

### 1. **Scrapy**
   - A fast and powerful framework for web scraping and crawling.
   - [Documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/)

### 2. **Scrapy-Selenium**
   - Used for handling dynamic content rendered with JavaScript.
   - [GitHub](https://github.com/clemfromspace/scrapy-selenium)

### 3. **Scrapy-Proxy-Pool**
   - Simplifies the use of rotating proxies for web scraping.
   - [GitHub](https://github.com/aivarsk/scrapy-proxy-pool)

### 4. **Fake-UserAgent**
   - Randomly generates user-agent strings to help avoid getting banned.
   - [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fake-useragent/)

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Configure the Scrapy Project
- Edit the Scrapy settings file (`settings.py`) to include additional configurations for Selenium, proxies, and user agents.

### 2. Run the Scraper
Use the Scrapy command-line interface to run the project:
```bash
scrapy crawl <spider-name>
```

### 3. Save Output (Optional)
To save the scraped data to a file:
- JSON:
  ```bash
  scrapy crawl <spider-name> -o output.json
  ```
- CSV:
  ```bash
  scrapy crawl <spider-name> -o output.csv
  ```
